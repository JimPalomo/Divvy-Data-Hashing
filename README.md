# Divvy-Data-Hashing

### Description: 
The project was divided into two separate parts. The first incorporated the development of a hashmap class for storing (key,value) pairs into a hash table that handles collisions due to the assumption of imperfect hashing. The second part of the project was to use the hashmap class and apply it to the provided DIVVY data. 

### Commands within program:
- Lookup by ID
- Lookup by Abbreviation (e.g. "63rd Beach")
